## I. Introduction to Security for Application Development
- DevSecOps (Development, Security, and Operations)
- SDLC (software development Lifecycle)

- OSI model (Open Systems Interconnection Model): a conceptual framework that standardizes how network communication occurs between devices.
- seven layers of OSI

- threat modeling
  - STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privileges)
- threat monitoring: scanning code repositories and containers to find security issues.
- code checker: scans source code for security issues.

- security terminology

## 2. Security Testing and Mitigation Strategies

- functional **security testing**
  - Ad hoc testing: completely unstructured; involves improvised, unplanned testing without any formal test cases or documentation
  - exploratory testing: loosely structured; an unscripted, experience-based testing approach where testers actively explore the application to discover issues. 
- automated security testing types
  - unit testing
  - integration testing
  
- **static analysis**: examing all code or runtime binaries to help detect common vulnerabilities.
  - SAST (static application security testing)
  - **SonarQube**: for continuous code quality inspection

    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8548a5d6-c475-4f97-be1b-d32c343fb309)
  - SonarScanner

- **dynamic analysis**
  - DAST
  - ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy): a tool wielded to uncover and guard against vulnerabilities in web applications.
